## 1. Project Overview & Tracks

| Track | Target Variable | Type | Dataset | Rows | Features | Primary Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Regression** | `charges` | Continuous (USD) | `data/insurance.csv` | 1,338 | 6 | $R^2$, RMSE, MAE |
| **Classification (Part A)** | `y` (`yes` / `no`) | Binary (0 / 1) | `data/bank-full.csv` | 45,211 | 15 (after exclusions) | Weighted F1, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix |

## 2. Dataset Descriptions

### Track 1: Medical Insurance Charges (Regression)
- **Source:** Medical Cost Personal Dataset
- **Objective:** Predict individual medical charges billed by health insurance based on personal attributes.
- **Features:** `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`
- **Target:** `charges` (continuous)
- **Feature Engineering:** `bmi_smoker` interaction term, obesity indicator (`is_obese`), age-BMI interaction.

### Track 2: Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction (Classification — Part A)
- **Source:** UCI Bank Marketing Dataset (`bank-full.csv`, delimited by `;`)
- **Problem Statement (What is happening?):**
  - A Portuguese retail banking institution executes direct telemarketing phone campaigns to sell long-term deposits.
  - Mass cold-calling without targeting leads to high operational overhead, customer fatigue, and low conversion rates (only ~11.7% of contacted clients subscribe).
  - The business objective is to identify patterns across customer demographics, personal financial status, and prior campaign contacts to predict which prospective clients are most likely to subscribe before initiating contact.
- **Why Classification to solve this?**
  - **Discrete Binary Outcome:** The target attribute `y` is categorical with two discrete states (`yes` / `no`), not a continuous numerical scale (which would require regression).
  - **Decision Boundaries & Class Probabilities:** Supervised classification algorithms learn decision boundaries to estimate the posterior probability $P(y=1 \mid X)$ of a customer subscribing given their profile.
  - **Actionable Campaign Triage:** Classification provides threshold-based lead scoring, allowing the bank to optimize the trade-off between precision (minimizing wasted calls to disinterested clients) and recall (capturing potential subscribers) using classification-specific metrics (Weighted F1, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrices).
- **Features:** Demographics (`age`, `job`, `marital`, `education`), financial history (`default`, `balance`, `housing`, `loan`), and campaign metadata (`contact`, `day`, `month`, `campaign`, `pdays`, `previous`, `poutcome`).
- **Target:** `y` (mapped to binary: `yes` $\rightarrow$ 1, `no` $\rightarrow$ 0; class ratio approx. 88.3% no vs. 11.7% yes).
- **Critical Feature Exclusion:** `duration` is **dropped** from the predictor set because call duration is unknown prior to call completion, constituting a realistic predictive-availability / data-leakage concern.

## 3. Algorithms Implemented (Review 1)

### Regression Track (`notebooks/regression.ipynb`)
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. ElasticNet Regression
5. Polynomial Regression (degree = 2)
6. Decision Tree Regressor
7. Random Forest Regressor (with GridSearchCV tuning)
8. Gradient Boosting Regressor (with GridSearchCV tuning)

### Classification Track — Part A (`notebooks/classification.ipynb`)
1. **Logistic Regression** (Baseline linear classifier, lbfgs solver, max_iter=1000)
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (Distance-based classifier, k=5 with scaled features)
3. **Gaussian Naive Bayes** (Probabilistic classifier with dense-transformation pipeline)
4. **Decision Tree Classifier** (Tree-based model with max_depth control, Gini importance analysis)
5. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** (RBF kernel, probability=True, standardized inputs)
*Note: Classification Part B (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, MLP) belongs to Review 2.*

## 4. Preprocessing & Leakage Prevention

- **Train/Test Splitting:**
  - Regression: 80/20 train/test split with `random_state=42`.
  - Classification: Stratified 80/20 train/test split (`stratify=y`, `random_state=42`) to preserve class ratios.
- **Strict Leakage Guard:** All scalers (`StandardScaler`) and encoders (`OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`) are fitted **strictly on training partitions only** inside scikit-learn `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` workflows.
- **Consistent Benchmarking:** The exact same held-out test split is used across all comparative models.

## 6. Installation & Execution

### Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SH-Nihil-Mukkesh-25/ml_capstone.git
cd ml_capstone

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to:
- `notebooks/regression.ipynb` $\rightarrow$ Click `Kernel` $\rightarrow$ `Restart & Run All`
- `notebooks/classification.ipynb` $\rightarrow$ Click `Kernel` $\rightarrow$ `Restart & Run All`

Both notebooks use relative paths (`../data/`) and run self-contained from top to bottom.

## 7. Academic Integrity & AI Assistance Acknowledgement

In compliance with university evaluation policies for B.Tech 23CSE301:
- Generative AI (**Google Antigravity / Gemini**) was utilized solely for code scaffolding, boilerplate generation, and notebook structuring.
- All analytical interpretations, exploratory observations, and conclusions are drafted with explicit verification tags (`DRAFT OBSERVATION — VERIFY AGAINST THE ACTUAL PLOT/REPORT`) to be confirmed against executed outputs by the project team.
- No model performance metrics, dataset statistics, or experimental results were fabricated.
